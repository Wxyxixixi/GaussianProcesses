# GaussianProcesses

## Overview

Gaussian Processes regression and classification implementations (GPR.ipynb and GPC.ipynb), as well as blog-style notebook (GPR_blog.ipynb) containing a simpler and more refined implementation (see https://michaeloneill.github.io for static site).

## Running the notebooks

1. Install virtualenv
1. cd to GaussianProcesses and execute virtualenv -p python3 venv to create a virtual environment
2. Execute source venv/bin/activate to activate the virtual environment.
3. Execute  pip install -r  requirements.txt in the activated virtual environment to install the necessary dependencies to run the notebooks.
4. Execute jupyter notebook to open a local server where the notebooks can be viewed/edited/run.
